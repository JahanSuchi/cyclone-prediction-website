# Cyclone Prediction System

## Introduction

The Cyclone Prediction System is a web-based application hosted on an XAMPP server that leverages deep learning models (GRU and LSTM) to predict local wind speeds and assess the likelihood of cyclones. The backend of the system is built with Python and Flask, while the front end uses HTML, CSS. PHP is used to integrate the AI results with the frontend.

## Features

- Predict local wind speeds using GRU and LSTM models
- Assess the likelihood of cyclones based on predicted wind speeds
- Expose predictions via a RESTful Flask API
- User-friendly web interface for input and displaying results

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Deep Learning Models:** GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Web Server:** XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend Integration:** PHP
